## Pricing Curve

A SONICSALE pool works exactly like Uniswap V2 or a Volatile AMM pool: it uses the `x*y = k` curve.
To account for the inexistent FTM at launch, a theoretical FTM amount is added to the pool. This is the
`Virtual FTM` amount.

## How is this accounted?
To account for this inflated FTM amount that doesn't actually exist, the token amount is also inflated by
a certain amount considering the pool's parameters (see below); so when the target price is achieved 
(when max ftm is the amount in the pool), both amounts are set to the real amounts and the price is kept the same.

## Why?
Other presale apps may use bonding curves or linear price. However, this pricing method has the following benefits:
- uses a liquidity model that everyone is familiar with: x*y = k;
- presale and resulting final pool are closely related in the way they're priced, since they use the same curve

## Virtual Reserve Calculations
A SonicPool takes 3 parameters:
- Max Supply (total supply of created token)
- Virtual FTM
- Max FTM

The contract will then calculate the virtual amounts to be used in pricing:

At pool creation, virtual reserves are:
- FTM reserve: Virtual FTM as set during creation.
- Token reserve: `maxSupply / (1 - (virtualFTM / maxFTM)²)`

## Example
A pool is launched with parameters:
- Max Supply: 5,000,000
- Virtual FTM: 1,000
- Max FTM: 20,000

This means the presale will end once 19,000 FTM worth of Token have been bought.

Reserve formula: `maxSupply / (1 - (virtualFTM / maxFTM)²)`

`5000000 / (1 - (1000 / 20000)²)` = `5012531.32`

Applying the `x*y = k` curve:

`5012531.32 * 1000 = k`

Solving for FTM reserve = 20000 (max FTM)

`x * 20000 = 5012531.32 * 1000`; `x = 250626.57`

Price at max FTM = 20,000 / 250,626.57 = 0.07979

Now, we must switch to using the correct reserves. They are:
- 19,000 FTM (max - virtual)
- 238,095.25 (sold tokens - max supply)

Price with correct reserves: 19,000 / 238,095.25 = 0.07979
