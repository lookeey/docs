## Launch your own token

You may [launch](https://docs.sonic.sale/launch) a token from the [main page](https://sonic.sale), by filling up a very simple form.

You must choose:
- Your token's name
- Your token's symbol (ticker)
- The maximum supply (the total amount of tokens to be created)
- The exchange where you wish the token to be traded on, after the token's **SONICSALE** ends.

After filling appropriately, click 'LAUNCH', and wait for the transaction to be fulfilled.
You will be led to your new token's page, where you can bump it and bring it to the front page.

## Advanced settings

If you desire, you can use the *advanced settings* by toggling the checkbox.

These settings override defaults set in the interface.
This configuration needs a higher understanding of how the **SONICSALE** works.

The parameters are as follows:
- Virtual FTM

  The **SONICSALE** uses a fake amount of Fantom tokens to create a trading pool that works just like any other exchange.
  The Virtual FTM is this fake amount. The higher it is, the more difficult it will be to change the price, but also harder to finish the presale.
- Max FTM

  After the (Virtual FTM + Amount of Fantom deposited to buy) exceeds this number, the pool will be locked and transferred to the desired exchange.
