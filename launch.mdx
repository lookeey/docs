## Launch your own token

You may [launch](https://docs.sonic.sale/launch) a token from the [main page](https://sonic.sale), by filling up a very simple form.

You must choose:
- Your token's name
- Your token's symbol (ticker)
- The maximum supply (the total amount of tokens to be created)
- The exchange where you wish the token to be traded on, after the token's **SONICSALE** ends.
- Your desired market type (whether the price moves easily or not, which affects how much will be raised in the sale)

After filling appropriately, click 'LAUNCH', and wait for the transaction to be fulfilled.
You will be led to your new token's page, where you can bump it and bring it to the front page.
